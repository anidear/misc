I am following tutorial on how to create a basic shellcode from Vivek (SecurityTube)

source: http://hackoftheday.securitytube.net/2013/04/demystifying-execve-shellcode-stack.html

In the website, all registers and compilation commands are for x86 machine (32bits). I am using an x64 machine, so I need to adapt some commands to suit my system.

This tutorial starts from 
	1. write shell32_asm.nasm, compile it, and dump a shell code representing assembly code from the compiled binary file(shell32_asm).
	2. write shell32.c and compile it to test that shell code from previous step works.

Both can be run in a single command:
	./run.sh
